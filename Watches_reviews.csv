It tells you your steps you've done, how many calories your burning, and it goes into detail of how you sleep, the weather, and you can see messages and change music on your smartphone.

173019570,20,4.4,"I shopped around for a smart watch online not knowing if I should get a Fitbit or an Apple watch! I wanted something very simple and not too fancy for work and not too big either because I have a small wrist! I went on pinterest and saw a picture of the Itouch Sport rose gold! I saw the price and I was very pleased! I went on the ITouch wearables website and the ITouch slim was exactly what I was looking for! Simple, comfortable for work and perfect for my small wrist. At this point, I had fell in love with the rose gold ITouch Sport so I bought both! I wear it well and it looks fancy when I go out! I can pair each watches on the ITouch wearables App and it's very convenient! Technical support help do that (thank you Jenn) since I'm pretty bad with technology. I love that you can see your sleep hours, heart rate, miles, blood oxygen pourcentage, steps, calories, notifications, controls music and pics! I wish there was more sports mode to choose from on the watches but it does the job for me so it's ok.The screen is colourful too!

173019570,20,4.4,"This smartwatch looks very attractive and modern with it's lime and black color scheme that gives it a athletic vibe as well. I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Gorgeous but difficult,"September 13, 2019",,6,2
173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0
173019570,20,4.4,"This smart watch is a true wonder.  iTouch Sport Smartwatch Rose Gold Mesh monitors my health, heartbeat, blood pressure, calories, sleep, etc.  iTouch Sport Smartwatch Rose Gold Mesh is very beautiful, delicate and elegant.

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

173019570,20,4.4,Although it is a beautiful watch design it's very appealing and looks expensive I'd have to say it's ok. I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face. For the price is not bad but the whole look of the display screen is not that nice but you get what you pay for I will post some photos so you can see what I mean and maybe it will help you on your purchase. Hope this helps,A little underwhelming,"May 4, 2020",,0,0

If you're looking for something with all the bells and whistles that will even take out your garbage, then you need to look at something that's a higher price point. If all you want is a basic fitness tracker with heart rate capabilities, this is perfect. It does have some features I wasn't expecting, like oxygen saturation and a stop-watch, which is nice. Charges quickly and lasts several days on a charge, even if you use the sport mode. The app is easy to use and is visually appealing.

What I find disappointing is that the plastic coating on the band is pealing off after only 2 weeks of wearing and I do not wear in the shower. Is this a defect?  While I consider this tracker on the cheaper end, I did not think it would do this at a 2 week period. I give it 3 stars due to the band pealing in such a small amount of time.

498134344,20,4.6,"The iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch in Rose Gold Case with Blush Strap is an excellent watch. It's very easy to put on and the band seems very durable. Should last a while. I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch. I truly love this Smartwatch and highly recommend it. The ITouch Sport Smartwatch is great for everyone not just athletic people.

I am a little skeptical about how accurate some of them are but it gives you a lot of options as to what works best for you. Other than that it was very easy to use, held a charge for a good amount of time and when the time came to charge it, it charged rather quickly. I unfortunately had an allergic reaction to the metal that the watch is made out of and it caused a very painful rash so if you have metal sensitivities keep that in mind.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more.

I opened it up and I think it be quite a struggle to change the battery meaning you're suppose to throw it out and get a new one.

And, when it is buckled like that, the end of the strap (the one with the holes in it) does not stay in the keeper (I don't know the exact terminology) on the strap (the one with the buckle on it). Too, I work (it's a physical kind of job) with the watch on. The band is leather (I think), but I've got a hunch that it's not going to last all that long from the way that it looks now.

Instead of spending over $100 dollars for another brand name watch like I did previously (...which currently needs repair), I opted to buy a ""higher end"" TIMEX to see what this ""middle"" ground may offer. Here's what I found:

The bracelet seems a bit better grade than your typical $25 TIMEX.
The watch has an ""indigo"" night light that really works and is a bit of an eye catcher but not enough of ""bleen"" to entice someone to want to ""lift"" it from you.
THE TICKER IS REALLY LOUD!!!. Having digital faced watches previously , this can be annoying if you focus on it too much. I can hear the thing ticking when I'm actually driving in my car w/o any music.
My model did not have a ""day"" indicator. Not a deal-breaker but better to have than to have not.
It's very easy to set the time and the date! My previous digital watches all had ""pages"" of manual instructions on how to work the 4-5 buttons individually or collectively. REALLY! I do enough technology 5 days a week for 40 hours. THE SIMPLICITY WAS A WELCOMED CHANGE!

Lastly, the watch really don't look that bad. I haven't received inquires from other people regarding where I can go out and purchase one but it suits me just fine. It catches peoples eye but their interest disspates immediately when they see TIMEX.

So there you have my comments on my high end purchase of a low budget item. It's kinda like the item in the old Sears Christmas catalogue (...I know i'm dating myself here) that had the superlative description ""Sears At It's Best!"" TIMEX does have some $200 plus watches but you ain't gonna find them in Wal-Mart and for that kind of money you can get a brand names that will get attention.

After the fake review was posted, I was concerned and went to a couple shops to verify authenticity. For all those who may be concerned, this watch IS NOT A FAKE. Completely authentic Gucci, and it looks pretty sick. Even comes with tags, a warranty certificate, and instruction booklet.

901358493,20,3.9,"The watch is just your typical digital watch - nothing special. However, it has one very bad problem which in my opinion makes it a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. It is easy to ACCIDENTLY get into 24-hour (military) time mode. If you think the instructions which come with the watch OR the internet will help you figure out how to get OUT of 24-hour mode, think again. The only mention of 24-hour mode in the instructions is that it is a ""feature"", but nothing about how to get in or out. If you search the web, the only ""help"" you will find is how to download the instructions, which of course puts you into what is commonly known as an ""infinte loop"".

- no count-down timer - there is only a stopwatch (count-up) function.

592319280,20,2.9,"This is an unbranded version of the LEMFO LEM T. It includes all of the same hardware without some of the software overlays. The build quality is good and there are even two screen protectors (with one installed, albeit mine was hanging off the screen). The only downside to this version is that it includes obnoxious full volume boot and shutdown music. The handful of watch faces lost by not buying a branded device are justified by the cheaper price and (extremely) fast arrival times. The OLED screen is slightly better in terms of visual quality than a TFT LCD, but at the cost of burin-in risk. The camera takes mediocre pictures even with a partial protector over it and the hardware is more than enough to play a lot of games, but the resolution may be a factor in which ones are truly playable. If you plan to use images from a current phone, you should also keep in mind that they will need to be resized before transferring them or they will not work. I have had best results with 1280 x 720 images. I prefer the matching buttons over the red power button of the branded version.

I purchased this one specifically because it has multiple alarms that I use as daily medication reminders. I bought this one to replace another women's Ironman watch. I'd made the mistake of getting a light pink band last time and all it did was turn grey and yucky. No amount of cleaning could restore it to a like new condition let alone make it pink again. One thing interesting about this watch is that on top of the alarms, it offers date or event reminders. The only problem with that function is that you can't label the event so you have to remember why you created it in the first place. Of course this watch also has lots of functions that an athlete would use, such as timers, count up and down and laps. It also allows 24 hour time which is my preference.

Anyway, this is the 4th women's Ironman watch I have purchased over the years. They always last a very, very long time and the battery is quite simple to replace on every model I've owned. There's just 4 tiny screws to remove on the back cover. This watch, as well as all the other Ironman watches I've owned is really sturdy and I pretty much never take off.

I dont know if that happens with all the watches but it does with mine. To me its not a big deal but if that seems like a deal breaker to you, then I suggest you look for a different watch.",NA,"August 27, 2011",,12,1

Other than some fraying on the Velcro watch band and the night light option wearing out, the watch is still working.  I felt that after almost 20 years, it was time!  

The ""new"" Expedition watch is just what the doctor ordered.  It keeps the time in two time zones and is good for travel.  Also, the watch is water resistant down to 100 meters if I inadvertently wear it and fall while fording a stream while hiking.  You can drop it and nothing will happen.  But the best feature is the Indiglo button which is separate and distinct from the ""old"" watch and allows you to light up your dial for night viewing.  The watch allows for independent alarms settings and a stop watch if you need it.

When it first arrived, I was thrilled with the look and feel of the item. Being a manual reading person, I couldn't wait to dig into it. I was quickly disapointed. There wasn't much to read (aside from an important note about resetting the hands if need be), and I assumed the watch was more-or-less for show. I came to this conclusion in part because two of the buttons that appeared to rotate on the watch don't. They only function as buttons for the chronograph. And the time is set like any other watch with a stem. I also had to adjust the band to fit which I accomplished by cutting some short sections from a small saftey pin to knock out the pins in the sections. (follow arrow direction) A bit of a process! I suppose someone could take it to a jeweler.
Anyway, I wanted to find out about the scales built into this watch. After all, that's what I was after. The aviation part. I came across this forum which had several links about using the slide rule.
http://forums.watchuseek.com/f7/how-exactly-do-you-read-pilot-watch-168357.html
Definitely worth reading if you like this watch.
After playing around with the dial, I found it marked very accurately. Although a flashlight might aid reading the numbers a bit.

The other watch I bought, among other things stated it had a TEN year battery, upon opening the instruction thing I get a notice that the battery is only good for TWO years. Here;s the best part concerning that watch: NO ONE COULD START THE WATCH ! !  Can I return these items at a store? or will I have to ship them back?

10745998,20,4.4,"PROS: After reading the other reviews I thought that this would be a great ""wear everyday"" watch. Some of the reviewers commented on the quality of the band being comparable to other fine watches. Upon receiving the watch, I must say that the Bezel and Case are very high quality. The action on the bezel is very, very smooth, no clicking. All 4 dials are fully functional. Mineral glass face looks great too.

Cons: My only complaint was the band. It was just another Casio semi-cheesy metal band, Some reviewers found that the Casio band is comparable to that of other fine watches and I would have to disagree.
