173019570,20,4.4,"I shopped around for a smart watch online not knowing if I should get a Fitbit or an Apple watch! I wanted something very simple and not too fancy for work and not too big either because I have a small wrist! I went on pinterest and saw a picture of the Itouch Sport rose gold! I saw the price and I was very pleased! I went on the ITouch wearables website and the ITouch slim was exactly what I was looking for! Simple, comfortable for work and perfect for my small wrist. At this point, I had fell in love with the rose gold ITouch Sport so I bought both! I wear it well and it looks fancy when I go out! I can pair each watches on the ITouch wearables App and it's very convenient! Technical support help do that (thank you Jenn) since I'm pretty bad with technology. I love that you can see your sleep hours, heart rate, miles, blood oxygen pourcentage, steps, calories, notifications, controls music and pics! I wish there was more sports mode to choose from on the watches but it does the job for me so it's ok.The screen is colourful too!

173019570,20,4.4,"This smartwatch looks very attractive and modern with it's lime and black color scheme that gives it a athletic vibe as well. I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Gorgeous but difficult,"September 13, 2019",,6,2
173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0
173019570,20,4.4,"This smart watch is a true wonder.  iTouch Sport Smartwatch Rose Gold Mesh monitors my health, heartbeat, blood pressure, calories, sleep, etc.  iTouch Sport Smartwatch Rose Gold Mesh is very beautiful, delicate and elegant.

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

173019570,20,4.4,Although it is a beautiful watch design it's very appealing and looks expensive I'd have to say it's ok. I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face. For the price is not bad but the whole look of the display screen is not that nice but you get what you pay for I will post some photos so you can see what I mean and maybe it will help you on your purchase.

If you're looking for something with all the bells and whistles that will even take out your garbage, then you need to look at something that's a higher price point. If all you want is a basic fitness tracker with heart rate capabilities, this is perfect. It does have some features I wasn't expecting, like oxygen saturation and a stop-watch, which is nice. Charges quickly and lasts several days on a charge, even if you use the sport mode. The app is easy to use and is visually appealing.

What I find disappointing is that the plastic coating on the band is pealing off after only 2 weeks of wearing and I do not wear in the shower. Is this a defect?  While I consider this tracker on the cheaper end, I did not think it would do this at a 2 week period. I give it 3 stars due to the band pealing in such a small amount of time.

498134344,20,4.6,"The iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch in Rose Gold Case with Blush Strap is an excellent watch. It's very easy to put on and the band seems very durable. Should last a while. I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has.

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

It's great to use while playing sports or exercising. It's like having a computer on your wrist. Its touch screen and easy to use. I would love to get smartwatches for other family members too.

You can see if someone is calling or what your text messages say (but cannot respond using the watch). The profile is quite slim and the band is very comfortable! The graphics on this are less chic than those of higher ticket smart watches, but this does the job just fine. It is also waterproof which is a huge plus for me. Overall, for the price of this smartwatch I think that it is good quality and would recommend for someone who wants a more intelligent watch for working out or daily activities, but not for any in depth usage.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch. I truly love this Smartwatch and highly recommend it. The ITouch Sport Smartwatch is great for everyone not just athletic people.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look.

I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep.

I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

173019570,20,4.4,Although it is a beautiful watch design it's very appealing and looks expensive I'd have to say it's ok. I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face. For the price is not bad but the whole look of the display screen is not that nice but you get what you pay for I will post some photos so you can see what I mean and maybe it will help you on your purchase.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements.

The pedometer, blood pressure,  and milage features all seem to be accurate. The battery life is phenomenal on the watch. Having your phone connected does drain your phone as any bluetooth device does. My only complaint is having to tuck the tail of the band rather than have a loop to hold it down. While you cannot make or send calls/texts, you do get the alerts. You can read your msg and send calls to voicemail. It is extremely handy to have this watch. My wife wants one just like it now.

You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Gorgeous but difficult,"September 13, 2019",,6,2
173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face. For the price is not bad but the whole look of the display screen is not that nice but you get what you pay for I will post some photos so you can see what I mean and maybe it will help you on your purchase.

What I find disappointing is that the plastic coating on the band is pealing off after only 2 weeks of wearing and I do not wear in the shower. Is this a defect?  While I consider this tracker on the cheaper end, I did not think it would do this at a 2 week period. I give it 3 stars due to the band pealing in such a small amount of time.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

I love the band color which is a combination of black and red. The band is made of silicon it is so soft on my hand.

Also has a sleep program to track sleep. Has a health app you can connect to to help your progress. I have it connected to my doctors office so I can keep track on what's important for me.

Unfortunately you cannot reply back to a text message but it's still pretty cool that you can still read the message. It shows up to 3 messages at a time. It also keeps track sports mode &amp; workout modes. The watch battery is fantastic. The battery life will last a few days until I need to charge it.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it.

173019570,20,4.4,Although it is a beautiful watch design it's very appealing and looks expensive I'd have to say it's ok. I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face. For the price is not bad but the whole look of the display screen is not that nice but you get what you pay for I will post some photos so you can see what I mean and maybe it will help you on your purchase.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

730014305,20,4.7,"The itouch air 3 watch is awesome! Firat off, the fit is perfect. I have smaller wrists, and am always nervous about the bulky faces. This one is perfect. The pedometer, blood pressure,  and milage features all seem to be accurate. The battery life is phenomenal on the watch. Having your phone connected does drain your phone as any bluetooth device does. My only complaint is having to tuck the tail of the band rather than have a loop to hold it down. While you cannot make or send calls/texts, you do get the alerts. You can read your msg and send calls to voicemail. It is extremely handy to have this watch. My wife wants one just like it now.

The graphics on this are less chic than those of higher ticket smart watches, but this does the job just fine. It is also waterproof which is a huge plus for me.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options. It's a nice looking, functional watch at an affordable price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",A Functional Stylish Watch At An Affordable Price!,"December 8, 2020",,0,0

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

The display does not fill the whole screen as the actual display size is 1x1 which is pretty small display but still viewable. Battery is great can get 3-4 days on one charge.

The face of the watch is quite large and that makes the digits easy to read but it does bump my hand a bit when I bend my wrist.  So I do wish that was a tad smaller.

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements.

I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch.

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

It was so easy to figure out all the features which are build in this smart piece. I can see calls, messages and notifications coming up on my wrist. The iTouch Air 3 smart watch is commited to keeping you on-top of your health by continuously monitoring your heart rate 24 hours a day, reminding you to hydrate, and we can also check oxygen levels in our blood. It also keeps track of the activity through its workout mode designed for running, eliptical training, cycling, and hiking and its multi-sports mode designed for basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. The power saving mode saves time giving the extended battery life so no hassle of charging it often. Just with one tap we can take the picture ,this function is so cool. I love the band color which is a combination of black and red. The band is made of silicon it is so soft on my hand.

Also has a sleep program to track sleep. Has a health app you can connect to to help your progress. I have it connected to my doctors office so I can keep track on what's important for me.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Gorgeous but difficult,"September 13, 2019",,6,2
173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face.

There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy. We would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",My 12 year old is very happy with this watch,"November 24, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it.

173019570,20,4.4,Although it is a beautiful watch design it's very appealing and looks expensive I'd have to say it's ok. I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face. For the price is not bad but the whole look of the display screen is not that nice but you get what you pay for I will post some photos so you can see what I mean and maybe it will help you on your purchase.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

730014305,20,4.7,"The itouch air 3 watch is awesome! Firat off, the fit is perfect. I have smaller wrists, and am always nervous about the bulky faces. This one is perfect. The pedometer, blood pressure,  and milage features all seem to be accurate. The battery life is phenomenal on the watch. Having your phone connected does drain your phone as any bluetooth device does. My only complaint is having to tuck the tail of the band rather than have a loop to hold it down. While you cannot make or send calls/texts, you do get the alerts. You can read your msg and send calls to voicemail. It is extremely handy to have this watch. My wife wants one just like it now.

The graphics on this are less chic than those of higher ticket smart watches, but this does the job just fine. It is also waterproof which is a huge plus for me.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options. It's a nice looking, functional watch at an affordable price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",A Functional Stylish Watch At An Affordable Price!,"December 8, 2020",,0,0

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

The display does not fill the whole screen as the actual display size is 1x1 which is pretty small display but still viewable. Battery is great can get 3-4 days on one charge.

The face of the watch is quite large and that makes the digits easy to read but it does bump my hand a bit when I bend my wrist.  So I do wish that was a tad smaller.

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements.

I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch.

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

It was so easy to figure out all the features which are build in this smart piece. I can see calls, messages and notifications coming up on my wrist. The iTouch Air 3 smart watch is commited to keeping you on-top of your health by continuously monitoring your heart rate 24 hours a day, reminding you to hydrate, and we can also check oxygen levels in our blood. It also keeps track of the activity through its workout mode designed for running, eliptical training, cycling, and hiking and its multi-sports mode designed for basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. The power saving mode saves time giving the extended battery life so no hassle of charging it often. Just with one tap we can take the picture ,this function is so cool. I love the band color which is a combination of black and red. The band is made of silicon it is so soft on my hand.

Also has a sleep program to track sleep. Has a health app you can connect to to help your progress. I have it connected to my doctors office so I can keep track on what's important for me.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Gorgeous but difficult,"September 13, 2019",,6,2
173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face.

There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy. We would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",My 12 year old is very happy with this watch,"November 24, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it.

173019570,20,4.4,Although it is a beautiful watch design it's very appealing and looks expensive I'd have to say it's ok. I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face. For the price is not bad but the whole look of the display screen is not that nice but you get what you pay for I will post some photos so you can see what I mean and maybe it will help you on your purchase.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

730014305,20,4.7,"The itouch air 3 watch is awesome! Firat off, the fit is perfect. I have smaller wrists, and am always nervous about the bulky faces. This one is perfect. The pedometer, blood pressure,  and milage features all seem to be accurate. The battery life is phenomenal on the watch. Having your phone connected does drain your phone as any bluetooth device does. My only complaint is having to tuck the tail of the band rather than have a loop to hold it down. While you cannot make or send calls/texts, you do get the alerts. You can read your msg and send calls to voicemail. It is extremely handy to have this watch. My wife wants one just like it now.

The graphics on this are less chic than those of higher ticket smart watches, but this does the job just fine. It is also waterproof which is a huge plus for me.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options.

The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy. We would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",My 12 year old is very happy with this watch,"November 24, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0
498134344,20,4.6,"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking.

Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated.

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the ""iTouch Wearables"" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine.

173019570,20,4.4,"This is such a gorgeous watch and I love the material of the wristband. It is extremely flexible and great for working out. I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking.

My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

498134344,20,4.6,"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it!

498134344,20,4.6,Watch has basic functions like many smart watch's on the market w/o the high price tag. Wearing the watch is comfortable with no movement. Design of watch looks great and classy with good size screen but only down fall is the actual display of the watch. The display does not fill the whole screen as the actual display size is 1x1 which is pretty small display but still viewable. Battery is great can get 3-4 days on one charge.

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy.

Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch.

The silicone band is durable and comfortable.

I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working. I would have loved better instructions in order to avoid the hassle but I really do love the watch.

173019570,20,4.4,"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",I love it! It's exactly what I wanted!,"September 22, 2019",,5,0

173019570,20,4.4,"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

I just received it and was excited and had a little issue but was resolved and was helped immediately there customer service is great from my experience. But the look of the screen is really tiny compared to the roundness of the watch face.

498134344,20,4.6,"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

498134344,20,4.6,"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",Ok if all you want is a step counter,"December 10, 2020",,0,0

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works.

The display on the watch is big which is a good thing for me because I have a hard time seeing things without my glasses!! My favorite feature is it gives you your heart rate and your body temperature which is absolutely wonderful. I just started walking so I'm hoping that this helps me out to keep track of miles that I walked my heart rate [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],I touch sport smart watch,"November 23, 2020",,0,0
730014305,20,4.7,This product looks great and the magnetic band I love never comes loose and stays in place ! Look the elegant look. I love that I can change the screen to any photo I want . The battery last at least 3 days . Here are the glitches I've experience. One I forgot it but it on for a while day and then the next say I wore it the whole day and slept with it on but it didn't check my sleep . Fwi also Experienced this with my Fitbit . So not sure what that's about . Also it kept flashing the sepcs like several times a day I can't figure out why ! And then it power cycled by itself yesterday day .   It does keep track of ur heart mean and blood oxygen level and you can receive text in it and get basic notifications but u can not answer a phone call from it . At least it didn't work for me . Oh and I love the charger for it it stays in place and connects to two little connectors and doesn't move ! Better  charger quality I've seen yet !

730014305,20,4.7,"The ITouch Air 3 Black Smartwatch is very nice looking and has a very clear screen that's easy to read. It is a nice size and not bulky.

730014305,20,4.7,"The iTouch Air 3 is a great watch overall. First of all, it's waterproof! It's easy to charge, and there are many clock faces to choose from. You can even download a picture and use that as your clock face! You can also track your steps per day. I started working out a few months ago and I've never owned any type of fit tracking device, so I love this feature. In addition to reading texts on your watch and checking the weather, you can also track your heart rate. There's also a relax button, which I absolutely LOVE! I can be a somewhat anxious person (probably includes most of us these days!), and it's something I use almost daily. You can also set the watch to remind you to drink water (different settings for that: hourly, between certain hours, etc), and when to wash your hands.   As much as I'm enjoying this watch, there are a few things about it I would change. I consider myself a fairly tech savvy person, and there have been a few things I still can't seem to figure out, such as the music button and how to use the camera. Not deal-breakers for me, as I always have my phone to do these things. But these features are included on the iTouch, and I'd like to know how to access them. Although the watch came with a warranty and a piece of paper basically listing the app to download, there's no instructions or listing of each feature and how to use it. I went to their website and didn't see anything either.  Also, as much as I love all the different watch faces, the fonts and graphics other than the watch faces are a bit dated. They look a bit old school to me. I'll include a picture for an example. But again, not a deal-breaker. The watch face is really all that will be displayed, and there are many great ones to choose from.  Overall, it's a great watch. It's stylish, many clock faces to choose from, and some great features such as the step counter and relax button. You can also change out the band, their website sells several options. It's a nice looking, functional watch at an affordable price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",A Functional Stylish Watch At An Affordable Price!,"December 8, 2020",,0,0
