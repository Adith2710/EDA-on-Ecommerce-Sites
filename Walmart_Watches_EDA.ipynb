I wanted something very simple and not too fancy for work and not too big either because I have a small wrist! I went on pinterest and saw a picture of the Itouch Sport rose gold! I saw the price and I was very pleased! I went on the ITouch wearables website and the ITouch slim was exactly what I was looking for! Simple, comfortable for work and perfect for my small wrist. At this point, I had fell in love with the rose gold ITouch Sport so I bought both! I wear it well and it looks fancy when I go out! I can pair each watches on the ITouch wearables App and it's very convenient! Technical support help do that (thank you Jenn) since I'm pretty bad with technology. I love that you can see your sleep hours, heart rate, miles, blood oxygen pourcentage, steps, calories, notifications, controls music and pics! I wish there was more sports mode to choose from on the watches but it does the job for me so it's ok.The screen is colourful too! So for literally 200$, I bought 2 watches and accessories too and it was a great deal for me!\",\n",

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the \"iTouch Wearables\" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]',\n",

I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working.

       "   'full_text': \"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

Capable of pairing to a Android and iPhone, simply by connecting it the bluetooth on your phone. I fell in love with this tracker as soon as I received it. Beautiful color and I can set the alarm to wake me up for work. Counts my calories throughout the day and can be connected to GPS. I couldn't have purchased a better fitness tracker. Super affordable, fits perfectly and made of great quality. I highly recommend to anyone in the market to purchase one.\",\n",

If you're looking for something with all the bells and whistles that will even take out your garbage, then you need to look at something that's a higher price point. If all you want is a basic fitness tracker with heart rate capabilities, this is perfect. It does have some features I wasn't expecting, like oxygen saturation and a stop-watch, which is nice. Charges quickly and lasts several days on a charge, even if you use the sport mode. The app is easy to use and is visually appealing. Syncs with the nutrition app I'm using, so I don't have to re-enter information. All in all, a worthwhile purchase - and inexpensive to boot.\",\n",

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy. We would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch. I truly love this Smartwatch and highly recommend it. The ITouch Sport Smartwatch is great for everyone not just athletic people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more.

You can see if someone is calling or what your text messages say (but cannot respond using the watch). The profile is quite slim and the band is very comfortable! The graphics on this are less chic than those of higher ticket smart watches, but this does the job just fine. It is also waterproof which is a huge plus for me. Overall, for the price of this smartwatch I think that it is good quality and would recommend for someone who wants a more intelligent watch for working out or daily activities, but not for any in depth usage.

The face is surrounded by a rose gold, as well as the clasp which goes great with the merlot color. I love being able to track my footsteps, heart beats per minute, sleep patterns, and all of its capabilities! It's so easy to use, you just swipe your finger on the face to access the different options. Another really cool feature is that it vibrates when you receive emails and messages. I don't need a device in my hand 24/7, I can just check my watch. It also turns on automatically when you put the dial up to your face. I'm also excited that it's waterproof!

The power saving mode saves time giving the extended battery life so no hassle of charging it often. Just with one tap we can take the picture ,this function is so cool.

It has slim profile and is easy to use. I trust its water resistance now and I've heard of folks who submerge it but I'm a bit scared for that. My only real complaints are the light is a tad dim but gets the job done and this is defidently a disposable watch. I opened it up and I think it be quite a struggle to change the battery meaning you're suppose to throw it out and get a new one. But hey for 11 dollars that's still not bad and I bet you could change it if you really tried. If you're in need of something that will actually be there for you and hold up the casio f91w will defidently make a worthy companion.\",\n",

I changed the housing from my old dz09 smartwatch to my new one. the straps on my old one were pure rubber but the ones on this one felt cheaper and worn down. maybe to safe on cost? eh its ok for what its worth.

I wanted something very simple and not too fancy for work and not too big either because I have a small wrist! I went on pinterest and saw a picture of the Itouch Sport rose gold! I saw the price and I was very pleased! I went on the ITouch wearables website and the ITouch slim was exactly what I was looking for! Simple, comfortable for work and perfect for my small wrist. At this point, I had fell in love with the rose gold ITouch Sport so I bought both! I wear it well and it looks fancy when I go out! I can pair each watches on the ITouch wearables App and it's very convenient! Technical support help do that (thank you Jenn) since I'm pretty bad with technology. I love that you can see your sleep hours, heart rate, miles, blood oxygen pourcentage, steps, calories, notifications, controls music and pics! I wish there was more sports mode to choose from on the watches but it does the job for me so it's ok.The screen is colourful too! So for literally 200$, I bought 2 watches and accessories too and it was a great deal for me!\",\n",

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the \"iTouch Wearables\" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]',\n",

I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working.

       "   'full_text': \"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

If you're looking for something with all the bells and whistles that will even take out your garbage, then you need to look at something that's a higher price point. If all you want is a basic fitness tracker with heart rate capabilities, this is perfect. It does have some features I wasn't expecting, like oxygen saturation and a stop-watch, which is nice. Charges quickly and lasts several days on a charge, even if you use the sport mode. The app is easy to use and is visually appealing. Syncs with the nutrition app I'm using, so I don't have to re-enter information. All in all, a worthwhile purchase - and inexpensive to boot.\",\n",

While I consider this tracker on the cheaper end, I did not think it would do this at a 2 week period. I give it 3 stars due to the band pealing in such a small amount of time.

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

       "   'full_text': \"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"My new ITouch Sport Smartwatch is super exciting! It has a bold, round, black face that is trimmed in a metallic gold tone. The band matches the face trim and looks very classy. This ITouch Sport Smartwatch is compatible with Android 9.0 and up or IPhones running IOS 13.0 and up. It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch. I truly love this Smartwatch and highly recommend it. The ITouch Sport Smartwatch is great for everyone not just athletic people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

The watch itself had some nice features. I am a little skeptical about how accurate some of them are but it gives you a lot of options as to what works best for you. Other than that it was very easy to use, held a charge for a good amount of time and when the time came to charge it, it charged rather quickly. I unfortunately had an allergic reaction to the metal that the watch is made out of and it caused a very painful rash so if you have metal sensitivities keep that in mind.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy.

I am not a good tech savvy but I was able to connect this smart watch with my iPhone easily ,I just have to connect the device to bluetooth in my phone settings. It was so easy to figure out all the features which are build in this smart piece. I can see calls, messages and notifications coming up on my wrist. The iTouch Air 3 smart watch is commited to keeping you on-top of your health by continuously monitoring your heart rate 24 hours a day, reminding you to hydrate, and we can also check oxygen levels in our blood. It also keeps track of the activity through its workout mode designed for running, eliptical training, cycling, and hiking and its multi-sports mode designed for basketball, baseball, football, and soccer. The power saving mode saves time giving the extended battery life so no hassle of charging it often. Just with one tap we can take the picture ,this function is so cool. I love the band color which is a combination of black and red. The band is made of silicon it is so soft on my hand. The best part of this smart watch is it is water resistant .I would say it is beautiful watch with wonderful functionality.It's a great buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

Also has a sleep program to track sleep. Has a health app you can connect to to help your progress. I have it connected to my doctors office so I can keep track on what's important for me. You can download an array of faces for the watch. It does seem a little big and blocky wish it was a tad bit smaller other than that I love my watch. Comes with charger.

Unfortunately you cannot reply back to a text message but it's still pretty cool that you can still read the message. It shows up to 3 messages at a time. It also keeps track sports mode &amp; workout modes. The watch battery is fantastic. The battery life will last a few days until I need to charge it.

I now where this watch all the time, its so comfortable, even when i sleep which is weird for me cause i cant even sleep with a shirt. This is a great watch I see why it's one of casios best sellers. It has slim profile and is easy to use. I trust its water resistance now and I've heard of folks who submerge it but I'm a bit scared for that. My only real complaints are the light is a tad dim but gets the job done and this is defidently a disposable watch. I opened it up and I think it be quite a struggle to change the battery meaning you're suppose to throw it out and get a new one. But hey for 11 dollars that's still not bad and I bet you could change it if you really tried. If you're in need of something that will actually be there for you and hold up the casio f91w will defidently make a worthy companion.\",\n",

I changed the housing from my old dz09 smartwatch to my new one. the straps on my old one were pure rubber but the ones on this one felt cheaper and worn down. maybe to safe on cost? eh its ok for what its worth.

I saw the price and I was very pleased! I went on the ITouch wearables website and the ITouch slim was exactly what I was looking for! Simple, comfortable for work and perfect for my small wrist. At this point, I had fell in love with the rose gold ITouch Sport so I bought both! I wear it well and it looks fancy when I go out! I can pair each watches on the ITouch wearables App and it's very convenient! Technical support help do that (thank you Jenn) since I'm pretty bad with technology. I love that you can see your sleep hours, heart rate, miles, blood oxygen pourcentage, steps, calories, notifications, controls music and pics! I wish there was more sports mode to choose from on the watches but it does the job for me so it's ok.The screen is colourful too!

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the \"iTouch Wearables\" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]',\n",

My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working.

       "   'full_text': \"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

What I find disappointing is that the plastic coating on the band is pealing off after only 2 weeks of wearing and I do not wear in the shower. Is this a defect?  While I consider this tracker on the cheaper end, I did not think it would do this at a 2 week period. I give it 3 stars due to the band pealing in such a small amount of time. This is why I would not recommend a friend to purchase.',\n",

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

       "   'full_text': \"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch.

The watch itself had some nice features. I am a little skeptical about how accurate some of them are but it gives you a lot of options as to what works best for you. Other than that it was very easy to use, held a charge for a good amount of time and when the time came to charge it, it charged rather quickly. I unfortunately had an allergic reaction to the metal that the watch is made out of and it caused a very painful rash so if you have metal sensitivities keep that in mind. I would still recommend to anyone looking for a decent smartwatch that wont break the bank. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]',\n",

       "   'full_text': \"I am new to smart watches – this is the first I have ever owned – and I really, really like it.  It's very pretty, and it fits comfortably on my wrist. I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

The face of the watch is quite large and that makes the digits easy to read but it does bump my hand a bit when I bend my wrist.  So I do wish that was a tad smaller.

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

Having your phone connected does drain your phone as any bluetooth device does. My only complaint is having to tuck the tail of the band rather than have a loop to hold it down.

It's great that it comes with its own charging cord! The watch fits comfortably on my arm. I absolutely love it &amp; want even more! This is such a perfect idea for a Christmas or a birthday gift. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

So not sure what that's about . Also it kept flashing the sepcs like several times a day I can't figure out why ! And then it power cycled by itself yesterday day .   It does keep track of ur heart mean and blood oxygen level and you can receive text in it and get basic notifications but u can not answer a phone call from it . At least it didn't work for me . Oh and I love the charger for it it stays in place and connects to two little connectors and doesn't move ! Better  charger quality I've seen yet !

I changed the housing from my old dz09 smartwatch to my new one. the straps on my old one were pure rubber but the ones on this one felt cheaper and worn down. maybe to safe on cost? eh its ok for what its worth.

I saw the price and I was very pleased! I went on the ITouch wearables website and the ITouch slim was exactly what I was looking for! Simple, comfortable for work and perfect for my small wrist. At this point, I had fell in love with the rose gold ITouch Sport so I bought both! I wear it well and it looks fancy when I go out! I can pair each watches on the ITouch wearables App and it's very convenient! Technical support help do that (thank you Jenn) since I'm pretty bad with technology. I love that you can see your sleep hours, heart rate, miles, blood oxygen pourcentage, steps, calories, notifications, controls music and pics! I wish there was more sports mode to choose from on the watches but it does the job for me so it's ok.The screen is colourful too!

I especially like the pulse and oximeter functions which are accurate and fast, comparable to a dedicated product. The build quality and comfort is fine and looks and feels premium in use. The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the \"iTouch Wearables\" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.  Overall the hardware is good and impressive, additional app updates and firmware updates would really help this watch shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]',\n",

I love the touch screen function and how you can connect it to an app. However, I had extreme difficulty getting the watch connected to the app. The packaging states to download a manual from the website, unfortunately my particular watch didn't have a manual to follow so I had to basically wing it to get the phone connected and functional with the app. It took way longer than I expected but I eventually got it to work and fell in love once I had my watch synced to the app and my phone. My favorote feature with this watch is being able to change the clock face. That was what took me the longest to figure out and I was thrilled once I got it working.

       "   'full_text': \"Pretty easy to set up as long as you have the correct app downloaded. The app you want to use to pair the itouch SPORT smartwatch is the ITOUCH WEARABLES APP. I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy.

       "   'full_text': \"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper.

First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch.

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"The i-touch sport Smartwatch in Rose Gold case with Merlot strap was a breeze to set up.  And that is a huge plus for me.  I love the color of the band and the strap is very comfortable.  The excess of the strap gets tucked underneath and I thought this would bother me but it doesn't at all.  The face of the watch is quite large and that makes the digits easy to read but it does bump my hand a bit when I bend my wrist.  So I do wish that was a tad smaller.  It is loaded with features including your oxygen level and temperature that a lot of other trackers don't have, so I love that. Pretty and functional!

       "   'full_text': \"The iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch in Rose Gold Case with Blush Strap is an excellent watch. It's very easy to put on and the band seems very durable. Should last a while. I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

The pedometer, blood pressure,  and milage features all seem to be accurate. The battery life is phenomenal on the watch. Having your phone connected does drain your phone as any bluetooth device does. My only complaint is having to tuck the tail of the band rather than have a loop to hold it down. While you cannot make or send calls/texts, you do get the alerts. You can read your msg and send calls to voicemail. It is extremely handy to have this watch. My wife wants one just like it now.

You can see if someone is calling or what your text messages say (but cannot respond using the watch). The profile is quite slim and the band is very comfortable! The graphics on this are less chic than those of higher ticket smart watches, but this does the job just fine. It is also waterproof which is a huge plus for me. Overall, for the price of this smartwatch I think that it is good quality and would recommend for someone who wants a more intelligent watch for working out or daily activities, but not for any in depth usage.

I opened it up and I think it be quite a struggle to change the battery meaning you're suppose to throw it out and get a new one.

       "   'full_text': 'The one i had before was the black kind, after 7 months of use the speaker died of every day use. it sounded like it was under water. There is no Included sim and sd cars but i knew that. the battery life with the sim on 3 bars was 14 hours till it died. takes 15 min to charge. 380 MAH battery. to put sim and sd card you have to take out the back, theres a slot for your finger. then you can clip that off and use a thin tool to take out the battery. push and slide out the holder. it uses old 2g signal. its a small range for calling and texting. came in a pinkish gold not pure gold in the images. I changed the housing from my old dz09 smartwatch to my new one. the straps on my old one were pure rubber but the ones on this one felt cheaper and worn down. maybe to safe on cost? eh its ok for what its worth.

I saw the price and I was very pleased! I went on the ITouch wearables website and the ITouch slim was exactly what I was looking for! Simple, comfortable for work and perfect for my small wrist. At this point, I had fell in love with the rose gold ITouch Sport so I bought both! I wear it well and it looks fancy when I go out! I can pair each watches on the ITouch wearables App and it's very convenient! Technical support help do that (thank you Jenn) since I'm pretty bad with technology. I love that you can see your sleep hours, heart rate, miles, blood oxygen pourcentage, steps, calories, notifications, controls music and pics! I wish there was more sports mode to choose from on the watches but it does the job for me so it's ok.The screen is colourful too! So for literally 200$, I bought 2 watches and accessories too and it was a great deal for me!\",\n",

The silicone band is durable and comfortable.  I had some issues finding the correct app to use, this model works with the \"iTouch Wearables\" app, not the other iTouch apps that are also in the app store. I also wished that there were watch faces that included seconds, all the ones provided only show hour and minutes. The notifications feature needs some work to better work with existing apps.

I did have a little difficulty at first, getting my watch to pair, but it did eventually. After pairing with the app and syncing with my phone, I was ready to start using the features and it works great! When paired and synched, you can get your local weather on your watch as well as texts, emails and other notifications.   It's set up is pretty simple, just swipe right or left on your watch to get to different functions. As far as I have found, there is no sound at all, just vibrations. The vibrations, in my opinion, are a bit too soft. I wish there was a way to change that because sometimes I barely feel it vibrate letting me know I have a notification.  You only can recieve texts through it but not actually text back. I like receiving text, email and Facebook notifications on my watch because I don't miss anything! You also get a notification when someone calls your phone too, it shows the contact or number of who is calling but you cannot answer from the watch. It's pretty awesome to be able to control my music and camera from my watch too. I can play and pause and skip songs with my watch when I have music playing.  I really love being able to track my steps and check my heart rate, even track calories burned and monitor sleep along with many other things. The sleep tracker is probably my favorite thing! I also love that you can set a reminder to help you stay moving throughout the day. I have noticed it does disconnect from the app every so often, not sure why this happens but it usually reconnects within a few minutes or so.  It's very stylish and I love the colors. It has many holes, with the perforated wrist band, to fit anyone's wrist. I really like the big watch face, it's bright and I can see it with no problems. It comes with a charger that just sticks on the back of the watch magnetically to charge. I just wish the charging cord was a wee bit longer but no big deal!  Battery Life - fully charged it will definitely last 2-3 weeks or longer before needing charged again! It's really awesome that it holds a charge for so long! As far as battery life on my phone (which is android) being that bluetooth always has to be on for the watch to work, it does drain the battery life quicker which means more charging throughout the day.  Overall, while there are a few minor bugs that need worked out and I'm sure will improve with updates, I think the itouch sport smartwatch is an excellent and useful little device. Before I had this watch, I really wasn't aware of calories burned in a day, or steps walked. Now I set goals and find myself challenging, well, myself! It pushes me to go further and since I get notifications on my smartwatch, I realize that my phone isn't constantly in my hand anymore (which is a good thing lol) This watch is comfortable to wear all day/night and is not heavy or bulky. I definitely recommend for anyone looking for an affordable smartwatch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"At first glance, the iTouch Sport Smartwatch looks like an expensive designer watch. The rose gold/blush colors are simply beautiful. The band is silicone, fits comfortably and is true to size. You could purchase additional straps, as the instructions show how to remove them, if needed. You'll need to download the app to your phone to get it to sync up. I had a bit of trouble with this the first few times. If you run into trouble, I'd suggest uninstalling the app and reinstalling it again. Make sure your phone and the watch are both fully powered as the firmware for the watch will need to update and you'll need to keep the connection going. After that, it was smooth sailing.  I primarily use the watch for tracking my calories and heart rate during workouts. I find that it's pretty accurate and helps me keep track of my workouts and weight loss. You can also change the background of the watch to a specific photo from your phone. My kids thought it was cool to have their picture on it. My only critique is that the screen of the watch is not going to be the entire face, it's a square within it. When I uploaded my personal photo for the phone background, it showed that it was only a square and then I had a black background around the rest of it. I would have loved to have seen the whole face be the screen and not just a portion of it. Otherwise, for the price, it is a very good fitness watch. Battery life can last up to 30 days and its waterproof according to the packaging. You can also set it up to get notifications from your phone.

Charges quickly and lasts several days on a charge, even if you use the sport mode. The app is easy to use and is visually appealing.

       "   'full_text': \"The iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch in Rose Gold Case with Blush Strap is an excellent watch. It's very easy to put on and the band seems very durable. Should last a while. I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"My son and I have gone on a weight loss journey, and he needed a smart watch to track different things, such as his steps, his heart rate etc. This iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch is not only a great value for the money, it works very well and has a ridiculously amazing battery life. My son has worn this watch for a week straight before and hasn't had to charge it. The smartwatch features a silicone black and grey perforated strap that is comfortable to wear day and night. I like that their are so many holes in it, so that it can adjust to any size. The heart rate monitor is spot on, and is great to keep an eye on so you are staying in your target heart range when working out. There are so many things this smartwatch can do and here are all the features it has: Sleep Monitor, Sedentary Reminder, Stopwatch, Alarm, Camera Remote, Pedometer, Music Control, Weather, Heart Rate Monitor, Messaging, Notifications, Custom Watch Face, Multi-Sport Mode, Workout Mode, IP68 Waterproof, Extended Battery Life, Body Temperature Monitor.  My son says the only thing that he wishes were different about this smartwatch were that the light up face would be the entire circle and not just a square on the inside of the circle, he says that would be alot more pleasing to the eye. Other than that, this watch is totally worth the value and has really been easy to use. It connected to my sons Galaxy Edge 6S+ phone with no issues at all. Very easy to use and so very handy. We would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"I guess I'm spoiled by my other smart watch, I was really hoping that I would be able to keep getting real time updates while wearing the watch, but unfortunately I was disappointed.   Pros:  It is waterproof, I was able to take a shower while wearing it, and it still functioned properly. The adjustable band makes it easy to fit on any size wrist. It does receive messages from your phone when it's close by, and does show current weather conditions depending on the watch face you choose. It does have a long battery life, being left on, and not messed with and still has quite a bit of battery life.  Cons:  The heartrate monitor only takes the heartrate every 30 mins, unless you tell it to manually, so if you are like me, and need something that needs/wants continuously up to min/hour heartrate readings this won't be the watch for you. I couldn't get the watch to continuously monitor blood oxygen levels, again it seemed to only be a feature that worked when prompted. While wearing it, it randomly would change the watch face on me, and even after I turned off the wake up feature it still kept coming on when I moved my arms. It didn't come with instructions other than to download the app, at first I thought something was wrong with the watch, because it didn't turn on, but after trying everything else, I put it on the charger and realized they send it to you without any charge on the battery. Also when looking for the watch to pair it to my phone, it's not a Bluetooth setup, it only pairs with the app, so there's no way of telling if it's disconnected unless you open the app which is very limited in function.   I didn't test any of the sports modes after getting frustrated with the watch face randomly changing, and the heartrate monitor only engaging every 30 mins.   Overall for the price point if you just want a step counter, and a watch that lets you see your messages, but not respond, there are probably other options available for much cheaper. I unfortunately wasn't impressed with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

It's also compatible with Samsung Galaxy S10 and higher, Apple IPhone X devices and higher and some LG devices. What is very impressive about this Smartwatch are all the wonderful features. First, you will need to download an app. Instructions are in the included Quick Start Guide. While I downloaded the app I began to charge my ITouch Smartwatch on my computer as recommended. The charge cord is included. Charging is very easy. It's a matter of aligning the watch to the metal pins and plugging the USB charge cord to a computer. I love that the watch face uses a swipe and tap motion. All the features within this Smartwatch are unbelievable! There are so many! Here are just a few: alarm, music mode, weather, blood oxygen monitor, body temperature sensor, sleep monitor hygiene assistant, sports mode, workout mode and so much more. My favorites are blood oxygen monitor, sleep monitor and body temperature sensor. These three features alone are invaluable to me. I have had so many compliments while I'm wearing my ITouch. I truly love this Smartwatch and highly recommend it. The ITouch Sport Smartwatch is great for everyone not just athletic people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

I often forget I'm wearing it, which is the way I think it should be with a watch.  I appreciate the functionality, too – it's easy to track steps, set reminders and alarms and track sleep.  Another cool feature is that you can use it as a remote control to take a photo with your camera phone.  I love that it buzzes when I get a text or phone call – and lets you read the text without having to pull out your phone.  For example, on a recent trip to the grocery store, I texted my husband saying “do we need milk?” and then of course I get multiple subsequent texts back that were not from him.  I love that I don't have to dig my phone out of my bag every time to see if it was him responding. As I mentioned, this is my first smart watch, so it's meaningful to say that it's been really intuitive – I haven't had any issues with figuring it out how it works. This would be a great gift for anyone in your life who could benefit from the above described functionality – I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': \"The iTouch Sport 2 Smartwatch in Rose Gold Case with Blush Strap is an excellent watch. It's very easy to put on and the band seems very durable. Should last a while. I love the silicone band, it feels very light on the go and all day. Even my teething baby is attracted to it because of the softness. What's unique about the watch is that the band folds in versus most bands - goes out and scratches everyone around me. Extremely attractive and modern looking. The design has an upscale look to it and the color has a feminine but professional look. Goes along with any outfit from dress up business clothes to sports outfits.The watch look very nice on my arm. My neighbor has been asking me about it already. I like how simple it is to use and connect via bluetooth to my phone. The tracking options are vast from heart rate to blood pressure to oxygen level. I am able to monitor my water intake, sleep. I can also check the weather, listen to music, get an alert and read a text message and email. It also keeps track of my sleep pattern which is great so I can see. This is definitely a watch that is made for the person who likes to be fit and stay fit. It helps with step counts and weight management as it's intended to keep you moving. It does display notification if you have a text as well. Overall seems to be a good product that is user intuitive and very functional with the vast features it has. The battery life is very long which is a huge plus. This watch truly helped me see the reality of my everyday patterns and motivated me to get moving to reach 10,000 steps or more. After having a baby few months ago, this watch is the perfect reality check to keep myself motivated and stay healthy. I will say, based on my experience this watch has been very accurate on the steps, weather, temperature, and heart rate measurements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]\",\n",

       "   'full_text': 'The itouch air 3 watch is awesome! Firat off, the fit is perfect. I have smaller wrists, and am always nervous about the bulky faces. This one is perfect. The pedometer, blood pressure,  and milage features all seem to be accurate. The battery life is phenomenal on the watch. Having your phone connected does drain your phone as any bluetooth device does. My only complaint is having to tuck the tail of the band rather than have a loop to hold it down. While you cannot make or send calls/texts, you do get the alerts. You can read your msg and send calls to voicemail. It is extremely handy to have this watch. My wife wants one just like it now.

You can see if someone is calling or what your text messages say (but cannot respond using the watch). The profile is quite slim and the band is very comfortable! The graphics on this are less chic than those of higher ticket smart watches, but this does the job just fine. It is also waterproof which is a huge plus for me. Overall, for the price of this smartwatch I think that it is good quality and would recommend for someone who wants a more intelligent watch for working out or daily activities, but not for any in depth usage.

My only real complaints are the light is a tad dim but gets the job done and this is defidently a disposable watch. I opened it up and I think it be quite a struggle to change the battery meaning you're suppose to throw it out and get a new one. But hey for 11 dollars that's still not bad and I bet you could change it if you really tried. If you're in need of something that will actually be there for you and hold up the casio f91w will defidently make a worthy companion.\",\n",
